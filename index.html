    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a 21-year-old second-year Software Engineering student. I aspire to become a software engineer to solve real-world problems and explore the field of AI. I'm a curious individual who enjoys reading, exploring, working out, and engaging with people.</p>

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>I was born in a small town called Markos and raised with my brother, mother, and father. Since childhood, I've had a unique identity and often challenged conventional paths, which sometimes brought struggles. My early years were filled with exploration, playing, and reading stories and the Bible. During high school, I began focusing on academics and achieved strong grades.</p>
